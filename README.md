### Hey ðŸ‘‹
I'm Atakan. 

Although I've only gotten into Computer Science about 2 years ago (2020), I've been using computers ever since I can even remember. At the start, it was mainly for gaming but I loved interacting with a machine seemingly capable of anything.

My curiosity led me to a constant series of sagas attempting to hack my way through what's readily available into the potentially possible. 

Want to play Astroneer co-op with my friend but he doesn't have a good enough pc to run it? The rabbit-hole may start as so.

Google:
* "How to run 2 steam clients on 1 pc" -> "Sandbox only 1 Steam client connected to internet"
* "How to stream game from pc with controller support" -> "How to stream gaming window while using another window with keyboard and mouse"

### CS Interests ðŸ’»
While I joined my Bachelor's program with the intent to specialize in cyber security, after falling in love with software development I decided to change my specialization to the latter. 

By now (June 2022) I have worked on 2 group projects for a total of 5 months to develop desktop and mobile applications allowing me to refine my programming skills and get more familiar with other parts of the development/engineering process such as CI/CDs, Scrum practices and documentation for architecture, requirements, etc...

### Work ðŸ’°
Even though I have another year left until I graduate from uni, I'm currently looking to start working. I'm looking more specifically towards software development/engineering at the moment but I'm open to others from the vast sea of offerings within CS world. 

I'm also particularly interested in machine learning (I'm taking a course on it right now) and may be looking into specializing in subjects such as this in the future. 

Even though the current industry has many scams and over-marketed hype, I think that blockchain technology is also really cool and I see great promise.

### Plans ðŸ“ˆ
I wish to start a YouTube channel very soon where I will document my learning process and approach while working on projects using technologies new to me because I'm really interested in either blowing peoples minds or letting them help me realise that I'm actually an idiot.

### Contact ðŸ“©
If you want to talk about literally anything, just hit me up!

I'm not on most social media platforms but you can still contact me on the ones that I use or send me an email.
